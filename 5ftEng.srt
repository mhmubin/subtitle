01:00:15,207 --> 01:00:17,876
I guess having a sick kid
wasn't part of his plan.

985
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:19,845
What about your mom?

986
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,013
She's beautiful and driven
and smart.

987
01:00:23,015 --> 01:00:26,985
She's just focused on me
and me alone.

988
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:30,120
So, starting tomorrow,
when I'm 18,

989
01:00:30,122 --> 01:00:32,523
I will be making the decisions
for myself.

990
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:34,159
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

991
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:36,496
Tomorrow's your birthday?

992
01:00:37,930 --> 01:00:39,196
You could have told me that.

993
01:00:39,198 --> 01:00:41,033
I don't have
a present for you.

994
01:00:42,635 --> 01:00:45,638
How about you just promise to
stick around for the next one?

995
01:00:49,007 --> 01:00:50,510
Come on.

996
01:00:51,544 --> 01:00:53,480
I'm getting out of here.

997
01:00:56,148 --> 01:00:58,350
There is this one theory
I like

998
01:00:58,618 --> 01:01:01,987
that says, "To understand death,
you have to look at birth."

999
01:01:03,155 --> 01:01:04,591
So, like,

1000
01:01:05,157 --> 01:01:09,061
while we're in the womb,
we're living that existence

1001
01:01:09,428 --> 01:01:12,362
not knowing
that our next existence

1002
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:14,297
is just an inch away.

1003
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:17,568
So, maybe it's the same
with death.

1004
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:21,572
Maybe death is just
the next life,

1005
01:01:21,574 --> 01:01:23,075
but an inch away.

1006
01:01:24,076 --> 01:01:27,946
Or maybe it's just
a big sleep, baby.

1007
01:01:29,181 --> 01:01:30,315

1011
01:01:38,157 --> 01:01:43,427
that Abby just blinked out.

1012
01:01:43,429 --> 01:01:45,197
I refuse to believe it.

1013
01:01:46,666 --> 01:01:49,468
What happened with Abby?

1014
01:01:53,740 --> 01:01:57,075
She was cliff diving
in California.

1015
01:01:58,010 --> 01:02:01,113
She landed wrong,
broke her neck and drowned.

1016

They said
she didn't feel any pain,

1017
01:02:06,285 --> 01:02:10,255
but how would they know
if she felt pain?

1018
01:02:11,558 --> 01:02:15,160
I was supposed to be there
with her, but I got sick.
